# PyTorch-101

### Deep learning: 

Subset of ML that use several layers sof non-linear transformation to progressively extract features from the input data. Uses multiple Neural Network layers, where every layer takes its inputs from the previous layer and progressively refines them to minimise their errors and improve accuracy. Uses high dimensional large data. Widely used in Speech Recognition, Computer Vision applications etc.

### Pytorch: 

Python library, developed by facebook, that facilitates DL projects. Supported by major cloud platforms; supports CPU,GPU,TPU training; supports distributed training.

### Tensors:

PyTorch uses data structure called Tensor to store data (I/P, O/P, intermediate representations). Tensors are a generalization for vectors, matrices or any n-dimensional data structure containing elements of the same datatype (like numpy arrays).

## Implement a NN to recognise objects. Using the CIFAR10 dataset
Training set is of 50,000 images labelled as 10 different classes : 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'. The Test set has 10,000 images. Each image is a RGB 32 X 32.

## PyTorch Dataloader
A data loader feeds data from the dataset into the Neural Network. Use mini batches of 64 or 128 samples to train data facilitating small memory.

## Model Design
Architecture for the model and initializing weights and biases

## Model training
Fit the training data into the model

## Instantiate the Model
