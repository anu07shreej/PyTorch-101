# PyTorch-101

Deep learning: Subset of ML that use several layers sof non-linear transformation to progressively extract features from the input data. Uses multiple Neural Network layers, where every layer takes its inputs from the previous layer and progressively refines them to minimise their errors and improve accuracy. Uses high dimensional large data. Widely used in Speech Recognition, Computer Vision applications etc.
